#1. stat_langevin.py
 	- Gaussian stochastic dynamics for a Brownian particle. Mean value and variance are calculated. Algorithm based on Ref.[1].
	
#2. FT_langevin.py
	- Gaussian stochastic dynamics for a Brownian particle under a harmonic potential whose center of mass is displaced with constant velocity (see Ref.[2]). 
	Fluctuation Theorem for work is calculated. Algorithm based on Ref.[1].
